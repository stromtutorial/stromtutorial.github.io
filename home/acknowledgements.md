I would like to thank David Swofford (phylogenetics and, particularly, programming phylogenetics), Jeff Thorne (likelihood-based phylogenetic inference), Mark Holder (many, many things), Dmitri Zaykin (C++), Christine Shannon and Austin French (really amazing undergraduate math teachers), Emma Kleinhenz (a truly inspiring high school math teacher), Joe and Shirley Lewis (the best parents conceivable), and Louise (my spouse, best friend, and partner in everything).
