Modify your {% indexfile main.cpp %} file to look like this:
~~~~~~
{{ "steps/step-04/src/main.cpp" | polcodesnippet:"start-end","" }}
~~~~~~
{:.cpp}
All weâ€™ve done differently is to create a `TreeManip` object and call its `createTestTree()` function, whereas previously we constructed a `Tree` object that called `Tree::createTestTree()` function in its constructor.

Try compiling and running the program now. The output is the same as before, except for two additional lines generated by the `TreeManip` constructor and destructor.
