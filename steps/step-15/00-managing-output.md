Before adding any more parameter updaters, we need to get organized with respect to the output generated by our program. Most Bayesian phylogenetic MCMC software stores sampled tree topologies and edge lengths in a tree file, sampled model parameter values in a parameter file, and sends other output to the console.

This step of the tutorial is devoted to creating an `OutputManager` class that will handle all these things. It will open a tree file and a parameter file before MCMC sampling begins, save sampled trees and parameters to their respective files during the run, and close these files when sampling is finished. Also, we will send messages to the `OutputManager` and the `OutputManager` will take care of displaying these to the console.
