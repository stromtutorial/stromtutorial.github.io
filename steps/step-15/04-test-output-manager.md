Run the program using the following `strom.conf` file:
~~~~~~
{{ "steps/step-15/test/strom.conf" | polcodesnippet:"start-end","" }}
~~~~~~
{:.cpp}

As before, the `ncatag = default:4` is required to force the model to include rate heterogeneity, which in turn forces the gamma rate variance (`ratevar`) parameter to be updated during MCMC.

Here is the output you should expect:
~~~~~~
{{ "steps/step-15/test/reference-output/output.txt" | polcodesnippet:"","" }}
~~~~~~
{:.bash-output}

This output does not tell the whole story, however. To see that the gamma rate variance parameter (but no other parameter) is being updated, take a look at the {% indexfile params.txt %} file that was generated by the `OutputManager` object. Note that all columns remain at their starting values except the “iter” column, the log-likelihood (labeled “lnL”) column, the log-prior (labeled “lnPr”) column, and the last column labeled “ratevar-0” (the gamma rate variance parameter).
