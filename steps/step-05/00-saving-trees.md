[Newick's Lobster House](http://www.newicks.com) {% indexhide Newick's Restaurant %} was the site of an historic 1986 meeting 
at which a standard was devised for storing descriptions of phylogenetic trees as strings. These newick tree descriptions (also called the {% indexshow New Hampshire format %}) became part of the {% indexshow NEXUS file format %} (described in [Maddison, Swofford, and Maddison, 1997](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/46.4.590)), which is a standard file format for storing systematic data that is still widely used despite the advent of [NexML](http://www.nexml.org).
