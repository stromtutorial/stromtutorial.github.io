description: Input, output, and manipulation of phylogenetic trees is an essential part of our toolkit. We first start by creating a tree in memory the hard way, by creating each node and connecting nodes by specifying each node's neighboring nodes. If this seems way too labor-intensive, you're right! In the next several steps, we will gradually work toward inputting and outputting trees as Newick tree descriptions.
