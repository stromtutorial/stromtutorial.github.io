The following main function gives the functions in the {% indexcode Lot %} class a test. Just replace all of {% indexfile main.cpp %} with the following:
~~~~~~
{{ "steps/step-13/src/main.cpp" | polcodesnippet:"start-begin_pause,end_pause-end","" }}
~~~~~~
{:.cpp}

Running the program now should produce the output below:
~~~~~~
Seed set to 12345
  Uniform(0,1) random deviate:             0.929616
  Uniform(0,1) random deviate (log scale): -0.11636
  Discrete Uniform(1,4) random deviate:    2
  Normal(0,1) random deviate:              0.722622
  Gamma(2,1) random deviate:               1.21748

Seed set to 12345
  Uniform(0,1) random deviate:             0.929616
  Uniform(0,1) random deviate (log scale): -0.11636
  Discrete Uniform(1,4) random deviate:    2
  Normal(0,1) random deviate:              0.722622
  Gamma(2,1) random deviate:               1.21748
~~~~~~
{:.bash-output}

This simply demonstrates that, after resetting the seed to the same value, the subsequent random deviates generated are identical to those generated the first time around (using that same seed).

Feel free to add more tests of the pseudorandom numbers generated by `Lot`. For example, the mean of several thousand deviates generated using `lot.gamma(2.0,3.0)` should be close to 6.0 (the mean of a gamma distribution is the shape multiplied by the scale). Adding the part shown in blue below would test this:
~~~~~~
{{ "steps/step-13/src/main.cpp" | polcodesnippet:"start-end","begin_extra-end_extra" }}
~~~~~~
